# A stakeholder is someone impacted by the decision
#
# Open Question: It seems like it can also be an expert who offers advice but it isn't clear if this distinction should be formalized (Cam thinks it is a very bad idea, also check w/ Betsy/Matt)
#
# Technically, a stakeholder can delegate to a Person object but it doesn't have to be someone in the directory.
# It could be a parent or board member; however, as long as stakeholders can adhere to the same interface, the system should not care.
